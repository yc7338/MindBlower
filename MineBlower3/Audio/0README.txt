This folder contains all the audio assets, with subfolders containing assets for objects of the specialized audio classes.

To replace a default asset without changing the code, simply replace its mp3 file with one of your creation, using the same name.  You might want to save the default somewhere...

Most of the specialized classes use multiple asset files, so these assets are grouped in subfolders with clever file names that differ only in a digit, usually just before the .mp3 extension.  In the code that loads the files, there will be  a for loop like the following:

for (int i = 0; i < sndArray.length; i++)
{
  String filePath = "Sound" + i + ".mp3";    // Sound0.mp3, Sound1.mp3, etc.
  sndArray[i] = minim.loadFile(filePath, 512);
}

which assumes the file names differ only in the embedded number, which is the loop counter.  You'll get the idea when you look at the code in the loadAudio() in the Audio object, and the the various constructors in the specialized classes.
