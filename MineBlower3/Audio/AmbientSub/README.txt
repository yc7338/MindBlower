Ambient Submarine Sounds
These sounds will be triggered randomly, one at a time
and localized to the x location of the sub at the time the
sound is triggered.  Sound files must be stereo to allow
panning.
The 4 sounds are:
Snd0: Creeeeeeak
Snd1: Clank
Snd2: Roger that (over an intercom)
Snd3: Pooooossshhhh
