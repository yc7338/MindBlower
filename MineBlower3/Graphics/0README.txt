This folder contains all the graphics assets, specifically the image files for the torpedo (only one frame) and the animation frames for the rest of the objects in the game, all of which animate.

Some of the folders contain the original animated .gif file from which the frames were extracted.  MineBlower doesn't care about these .gif files.
